## About

Computer software/hardware design and innovation specialist with a drive to give back to the community and a strong foundation in engineering principles across multiple platforms and technologies. Experienced in back-end development, testing, and debugging code with a focus on cloud development/architecture (AWS).

B.S Computer Engineering - University of Hawaii at Manoa.

Outside of my professional commitments, I'm an avid gamer with a penchant for rhythm games and League of Legends, where the rigors of being an ADC main have instilled in me the significance of teamwork and personal ownership over outcomes.

Parallel to my gaming pursuits, I'm a devoted car enthusiast, deriving excitement from exploring diverse automotive builds and narratives. This passion showcases my appreciation for craftsmanship, innovation, and the narratives woven by vehicles.

These pursuits underscore my multifaceted nature and unwavering commitment to holistic growth.
